# [DOGGYCAFE](https://ilswh.github.io/doggycafe)

Doggy Cafe is a cafe for dog-families in beautiful surroundings.
The website consist of five pages; home, menu, about, gallery and contact. 

My hope is that this site let's more people know more about the Doggy Cafe and makes people curious.
The target audience is people with dogs, people who love dogs and people who want to enjoy the countryside of Uppsala, Sweden.
The site will be useful for this audience because they will discover a place peace and joy.

Consider adding a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.
Here's your deployed site as an example:

## UX

My design process started with sketches with pen and paper and proceeded to making wireframes. 
After that I started creating the html structure. Lastly I started styling with css.


### Colour Scheme

I chose to keep it simple and stick with black and white. 
When it comes to the photos, I wanted colors that felt close to nature. 
For the background picture I wanted something earthy and grounded.
As for the gallery I wanted to expand and add the blues together with greens for some crisp. 
But still in the same place which is the caring embrace of nature.
Explain your colours and the colour scheme.

- Black used for text.
- White used for background.
- White used for header and footer


### Typography

I chose Times New Roman although it is not made for the web, it is my favourite as it gives me the feeling of having met before.
I used icons from Font Awesome.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

I've used ['Mockflows WireframePro'](https://www.mockflow.com/apps/wireframepro/) to design my site wireframes.

focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
