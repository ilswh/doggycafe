Try to remember when to use section and when to use div. Don't remember so I research when to use section and when to use div.
Find: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-section-and-div-tags-in-html/
Make changes in code from info above. 

Have three problems:
1. Pictures don't work.
2. Opening hours is not footer background color.
3. The text in homepage/index.html links to about.html

Solution?
1. Realize that I haven't saved changes. Click save on each file and git add, commit and push after each. Now the picture in menu works. Not the others.
2. Add id="footer" to the section in footer and copy-paste background color from id="social-media" to id="footer. Does not work. 
3. Add text-decoration: none; color: black to body. Does not work.

Try to push down footer with, flex: 0; on footer and flex: 1; on main. Does not work. 
So I rehearse and read --> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
