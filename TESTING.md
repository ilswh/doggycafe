# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

I have validated my HTML and CSS code.
I have tested the project in threee different browsers.
 

## Code Validation

Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).


### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Responsiveness

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

Sample responsiveness testing documentation:

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

| Device | Home | Menu |  About |  Gallery | Contact | Confirmation |
| Computer | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ipad | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Iphone | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Did not have time to add relative paths, all is found in documentation.



## Lighthouse Audit

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.
