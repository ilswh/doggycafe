                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Our cafe started from a concern of our family. Our humans always had and left us alone and abonded.
                    For
                    what
                    felt like forever. They wanted to bring us, we could tell. But still, they always said that we were
                    not
                    allowed. All of us in the
                    family thought it was very silly. So we decided to change that. And make sure the humans stay with
                    us.
                    Turns out they abandoned us for coffe and
                    yummies in a beautiful enviroment. So we looked around and showed the silly humans how beautiful it
                    is
                    right
                    here. At home. The humans realized that all they needed to do was put on some coffe and make some
                    yummies.
                    After doing that, they looked at us in our beautiful eyes and realized, that was not all they had to
                    do.
                    So,
                    they started doing things that humans do. Come!
                    <br>
