            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Our cafe started from a concern of our family. Our humans always had and left us alone and abonded. For
                what
                felt like forever. They wanted to bring us, we could tell. But still, they always said that we were not
                allowed. All of us in the
                family thought it was very silly. So we decided to change that. And make sure the humans stay with us.
                Turns out they abandoned us for coffe and
                yummies in a beautiful enviroment. So we looked around and showed the silly humans how beautiful it is
                right
                here. At home. The humans realized that all they needed to do was put on some coffe and make some
                yummies.
                After doing that, they looked at us in our beautiful eyes and realized, that was not all they had to do.
                So,
                they started doing things that humans do. Come!
                <br>
                Love,
