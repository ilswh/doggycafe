                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Our cafe started from a concern of our family. 
                    Sometimes our humans left for what felt like forever. They wanted to bring us, we could tell. But still, they always said that we were
                    not allowed. All of us in the family thought it was very silly. So we decided to change that. And make sure the humans always stay with
                    us. 
                    <br>
                    Turns out they abandoned us for coffe and yummies in a beautiful enviroments. So we looked around and showed the silly humans how beautiful it is
                    right here. At home. The humans realized that all they needed to do was put on some coffe and make some yummies.
                    <br>
                    After doing that, they looked at us in our beautiful eyes and realized, that was not all they had to do.
                    So, they started doing things that humans do. And we still watch them. Until we fall asleep.
                    <br>
                    Hope to see you all soon!
                    <br>
                    Love,
